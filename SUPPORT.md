# Support

## Commercial Support

The NGINX S3 Gateway project itself does *not* have a commercial support 
offering. However, NGINX and njs, the technologies the gateway is built with 
does have commercial support. This means that the specific configuration and
Javascript files that make up this solution does not have support, but the
underlying technologies that run the gateway do have support.
